			<p>Some relevant facts about me: </p>
			<ul class="facts">
				<li>I'm currently a sophomore majoring in computer science and statistics at Carnegie Mellon University.</li>
				<li>I am a teaching assistant for an introduction to data structures course, which is a lot of fun. Most of the students are still in their first year of computer science education, so it's exciting getting to show them the many applications of computer science.</li>
				<li>I'm still exploring computer science, but I've recently become interested in machine learning, which combines my two loves of computer science and statistics. I am currently taking my first machine learning course, and I am very excited to learn more!</li>

			</ul>

			<p>Some not so relevant facts about me: </p>
			<ul class="facts">
				<li>I own far too many dresses for my own good, especially considering I live in drab and cold Pittsburgh for most of the year.</li>
				<li>I love jigsaw puzzles. Over winter break, I started working on a 5000 piece puzzle - my largest one yet - and I'm excited to work on it some more next time I go home. </li>
				<li>I love strategy games, like <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9220/saboteur">Saboteur</a> and <a href="http://www.catan.com/">Settlers of Catan</a>. I caution you about playing with me though: I am likely to lie to your face and then stab you in the back! </li>
